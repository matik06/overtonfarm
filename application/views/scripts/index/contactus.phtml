		<b>Here are directions from the M1</b> Exit at 23a (East Midlands airport) or 24 and take A50 (Stoke on Trent direction). Stay on A50 following brown signs to Alton Towers until you approach Uttoxeter. 
		You will go over the River Dove on A50 just outside Uttoxeter and then straight over a large roundabout with The Racecourse pub on it. Keep going straight on and then over the next smaller roundabout with Mc Donald's and petrol station on right (do not go right for Alton Towers here). Keep in left lane over this roundabout, past the Travel Lodge and then take first slip off left for A522 Cheadle off A50. As soon as you turn off the A50, bear right at small roundabout heading on A522 for Cheadle. You will head right back over the A50 and then past a huge JCB Worlds Parts Centre on your left. Keep going on the same A522 road, past another new JCB factory being built, through Beamhurst (past Cock Inn pub on your left) and then about a half a mile on, slow down as you approach Fole. You will see the 30 mph signs and drop your speed right down as you need to take a right in Fole on a really nasty bend up/off-set Xroads up Fole lane towards Hollington. Head up this lane for about half a mile and we are the 3rd farm on the left. Our neighbouring farm just before us on the left is also confusingly called Overton so don't stop there - keep going down the little hill and we are at the bottom clearly signposted as Overton Farm & Boarding Kennels. We also have a Certified Camping & Caravanning site sign at the bottom of our drive. Just go over the cattle grid at the bottom and bear right up to the very top of the drive to the large shed. Any problems at all, please just call me on 07860 95 95 92.<BR><BR>
		<b>Coming up from the M6</b>, take the A518 to Uttoxeter out of Stafford. You then need to pick up the A522 out of Uttoxeter, heading for Cheadle.  After leaving Uttoxeter, you will eventually drive over the top of the A50 and then past a huge JCB Worlds Parts Centre on your left. Keep going on the same A522 road, past another new JCB factory being built, through Beamhurst (past Cock Inn pub on your left) and then about a half a mile on, slow down as you approach Fole.

		<b>Coming down from the M6</b>: Leave the motorway at Junction 16 and follow the A500 to Stoke on Trent. Exit A500 onto A50 for Derby. Leave the A50 just before reaching Uttoxeter (just past the JCB World Parts Centre on your left). Turn left off A50 onto the A522 for Cheadle. Keep going on the same A522 road, past another new JCB factory being built, through Beamhurst (past Cock Inn pub on your left) and then about a half a mile on, slow down as you approach Fole.
